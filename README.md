# OOP
<p>
 OOP is an abbreviation of Object Oriented Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class. OOP is a very important topic in programming and every programmer must know how to use it in his code.
So in this project I tried to cover some of the main concepts of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Swift programming language.



## Code

<p>In this project I used : 
 <ol>
  <li>Classes.
    <ul>
      <li>Base class.</li>
      <li>Derived class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Access Modifiers
    <ul>
      <li>Public : public access modifiers are accessible from everywhere in our project. </li>
      <li>Private :  private access modifiers are accessible only inside a class. </li>
      <li>internal : internal access modifiers are accessible inside the class and anywhere inside the same project file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inheritance.</li>
  <li>Polymerphism.
  <ul>
      <li>Method Overloading : two functions with the same name but different signature.</li>
      <li>Method Overriding : two functions with the same name and signature but different body.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Protocol
</ol>
